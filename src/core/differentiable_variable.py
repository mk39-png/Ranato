"""
Original ASOC code utilizes the AutoDiff library by Wenzel Jakob. Based on code by Jon Kaldor
and Eitan Grinspun.

ORIGINAL PURPOSE: So, this file focuses on utilizing automatic differentiation via JAX. 
UPDATED PURPOSE: the methods in this class do not seem to be used elsewhere aside from testing.
